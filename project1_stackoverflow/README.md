# Project Motivation
This is the first project from the Data Science Nanodegree program from Udacity. I chose to analyze survey results from stackoverflow because I am trying to break into the tech industry from a non-technical background, and it would be helpful for me and people like me to gain some insights from this analysis.

In this project, I analyzed the 2017 StackOverflow survey results, in attempt to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most valued skills in the tech industry?
2. What actions should you take to break into the field?
3. Does higher education lead to higher salaries and job satisfaction?
4. Can we predict the salary?

# File Descriptions
 - **analysis.ipynb** - project notebook with code and markdown cells
- **Data** - [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)
  - **survey_results_public.csv** - survey results of 154 columns and 19102 rows
  - **survey_results_schema.csv** - survey results column descriptions (questions asked in the survey)
- **col_descriptions.txt** - a text file I created to capture each column description along with 3 unique values from that column for easier and quicker data understanding

# Results and Findings
The article written on this project can be found here: [A StackOverflow Survey Analysis](https://medium.com/@kevingao1136/a-stackoverflow-survey-analysis-e44130a3c82b)

- The top 3 most valued skills in the tech industry are ranked as the following: **“getting things done”, “communication”, and “algorithms and data structures”**.
- The top 3 advice for you to break into the field is **“take online courses”, “buy books and work through the exercises”, and “contribute to open sources”**.
- People with advanced degrees tend to have higher salaries around the 50K income level. However, people who **earn much higher than 50K hold either advanced or non-advanced degrees!**
